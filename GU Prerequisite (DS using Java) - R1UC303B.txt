1. Data Types and Type Casting
Problem Statement: Write a program that reads two integers and a floating-point number. Perform bitwise operations on the integers and arithmetic operations involving all three numbers. Use type casting where necessary to ensure correct results and avoid overflow/underflow.

Description: Ensure that you correctly cast between data types to avoid any potential overflow or underflow issues during arithmetic operations. Also, explore how different data types interact with each other.

Input Format:

Three lines, each containing one number. The first two lines contain integers, and the third line contains a floating-point number.
Output Format:

Print the result of ((int1 & int2) | (int1 ^ int2)) as an integer.
Print the result of (int1 * float_num + int2 / float_num) as a floating-point number.

Sample Input :
8

3.3
Sample Output :

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int int1, int2;
    float float_num;
    scanf("%d", &int1);
    scanf("%d", &int2);
    scanf("%f", &float_num);
    int bitwise_result = (int1 & int2) | (int1 ^ int2);
    float arithmetic_result = int1 * float_num + int2 / float_num;
    printf("%d\n", bitwise_result);
    printf("%.4f\n", arithmetic_result);

    return 0;
}




2. Operators and Associativity
Problem Statement: Write a program that reads an integer n, followed by n integers, and then applies a complex expression involving multiple operators and parentheses. The expression should be evaluated in a specific order demonstrating operator precedence and associativity.

Description: Define an expression like (((x1 + x2) - x3) * x4 / x5) % x6 and ensure the operators are applied correctly according to their precedence and associativity rules. The program should read the values and compute the result.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements.
The next n lines contain one integer each.
Output Format:

Print the result of the complex expression.
Sample Input:
6
5
10

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n < 6) {
        printf("Error: Not enough inputs.\n");
        return 1;  // Exit with error code
    }
    int x[6];
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &x[i]);
    }
    int result = (((x[0] + x[1]) - x[2]) * x[3] / x[4]) % x[5];
    printf("%d\n", result);

    return 0;
}




3.Character Frequency Swap
Question: Write a C program that reads a string from the user and swaps the most frequent character with the least frequent character in the string.

Description: The program should take a string input from the user, determine the most and least frequent characters (case insensitive), and swap their occurrences in the string.

4.Complex Menu Navigation using Switch Statement
Problem Statement:
Write a C program that simulates a menu-driven application for a library management system using the switch statement. The menu should offer the following options:

Add a book
Display books
Search for a book by title
Exit
The twist is that each option should lead to a submenu with additional choices. For example, the "Add a book" option should allow the user to enter the title, author, and year of publication. The "Display books" option should display all books in a specific format. The "Search for a book by title" option should allow for a partial title search.

Description:

The program should use the switch statement to handle the main menu and each submenu.
Implement functions for each submenu operation.
Use dynamic memory allocation to store book details.
Use a struct to represent each book.

Input Format:

The user inputs the menu choice followed by submenu choices as required.
The input ends when the user selects the "Exit" option.

Output Format:

The output varies based on the selected menu and submenu options, including confirmation messages and book details.

The below are the output for corresponding operation:

Add a book:

Book added successfully.

Display books:

Case1:

No books in the library.

Case2:

Books in library:
Title: < Title >, Author: < Author >, Year: < Year >

Seach for a book by title:

Case1:

No book found with the given title.

Case2:

Books found:
Title: < Title >, Author: < Author >, Year: < Year >
